Perfect! I've updated the README with your specific GitHub repository information. The LLM coder now has:

1. **Your exact repository URL**: `https://github.com/w4ester/pydantic-ai-demo`
2. **Your GitHub Pages URL**: `https://w4ester.github.io/pydantic-ai-demo/`
3. **Direct link to settings**: `https://github.com/w4ester/pydantic-ai-demo/settings/pages`

The README is now ready for the LLM coder to:
- Review your `index.html` file for any issues
- Connect your local VSCode folder to your GitHub repository
- Help you deploy to GitHub Pages

The key commands they'll need to run in your VSCode terminal are:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/w4ester/pydantic-ai-demo.git
git add index.html
git commit -m "Initial commit: Pydantic AI + Logfire demo"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then you'll need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, and your demo will be live at `https://w4ester.github.io/pydantic-ai-demo/`!
