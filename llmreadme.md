# README for LLM Coder - Pydantic AI Demo Setup

## Current Status
- ✅ GitHub repository created (not yet linked to local VSCode folder)
- ✅ `index.html` file ready for review
- ⏳ Need to connect local folder to GitHub remote
- ⏳ Need to deploy via GitHub Pages

## IMPORTANT: Pre-deployment Checklist for index.html

Please review the `index.html` file for the following potential issues before we push to GitHub:

### 1. **API Key Security Checks**
- [ ] Verify NO hardcoded API keys in the code
- [ ] Confirm localStorage is used for key storage
- [ ] Check that example keys (if any) are clearly marked as placeholders

### 2. **External Dependencies**
- [ ] All CSS is inline (no external stylesheets that might break)
- [ ] No CDN dependencies that require API keys
- [ ] No local file references (images, fonts, etc.)

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**
- [ ] Check all `onclick` handlers are properly defined
- [ ] Verify all function names match between HTML and script
- [ ] Ensure no console.log statements with sensitive data
- [ ] Confirm error handling for failed API calls

### 4. **CORS and API Endpoints**
- [ ] OpenAI API endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- [ ] Verify no proxy endpoints that won't work from GitHub Pages
- [ ] Check for any localhost references that need removal

### 5. **GitHub Pages Compatibility**
- [ ] File is named exactly `index.html` (lowercase)
- [ ] All internal links use relative paths
- [ ] No server-side code requirements
- [ ] Meta tags present for proper rendering

### 6. **UI/UX Elements**
- [ ] Loading spinners have proper show/hide logic
- [ ] Modal for API key setup displays on first load
- [ ] All buttons have disabled states during API calls
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### 7. **Placeholder Content**
- [ ] Update any "YOUR-USERNAME" placeholders
- [ ] Check for TODO comments that need addressing
- [ ] Verify example data is appropriate for demo

## Specific Areas to Double-Check

```javascript
// 1. Check this line exists and uses environment variable or localStorage:
let openaiKey = localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key') || '';

// 2. Verify API calls include proper error handling:
try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
        // ... 
    });
} catch (error) {
    // Should show user-friendly error
}

// 3. Ensure no debug code remains:
// Remove any console.log(apiKey) statements
```

## Git Commands to Link and Deploy

Once you've verified the above, here are the commands to run in your VSCode terminal:

```bash
# 1. Initialize git in your local folder (if not already done)
git init

# 2. Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/w4ester/pydantic-ai-demo.git

# 3. Check remote is added correctly
git remote -v

# 4. Add files to staging
git add index.html
git add README.md  # if you have one
git add .gitignore # if you have one

# 5. Commit your files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Pydantic AI + Logfire demo"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 7. Enable GitHub Pages:
# - Go to: https://github.com/w4ester/pydantic-ai-demo/settings/pages
# - Source: Deploy from a branch
# - Branch: main
# - Folder: / (root)
# - Save
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, check:

1. **Page loads at**: `https://w4ester.github.io/pydantic-ai-demo/`
2. **API key modal** appears on first visit
3. **Demo functions** after entering valid OpenAI API key
4. **No console errors** in browser DevTools
5. **Mobile responsive** design works

## Common Issues & Fixes

### If API calls fail:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API key is valid and has credits
- Ensure no ad blockers are interfering

### If styles look broken:
- Check all CSS is inline in the HTML
- Verify no external font dependencies

### If JavaScript doesn't work:
- Check for syntax errors in console
- Verify all functions are defined
- Ensure event listeners are properly attached

## Questions to Answer Before Push

1. **Repository name**: ✅ Confirmed as `pydantic-ai-demo`
2. **GitHub username**: ✅ `w4ester`
3. **Additional files**: Do you have README.md, .gitignore, or other files to include?
4. **Custom domain**: Will this use default GitHub Pages URL or custom domain?

## Next Steps After Review

1. Address any issues found in the checklist
2. Update placeholders with actual values
3. Run the git commands to link and push
4. Enable GitHub Pages
5. Test the live deployment
6. Share link with team for demo
